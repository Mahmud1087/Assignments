# Task Title: Week 3 Tasks CSS Fundamentals

### Using Replit, build a simple HTML & CSS-driven website with a few linked pages and styled content.

### How to do it:

* Create a simple portfolio website with the following information

    1. About me section
    2. Contact page
    3. Services section
    4. Projects
    5. Using HTML semantics, you should have a header and a footer tag
    6. Add a navigation menu at the top of the home page.
    7. You should use inline linking to the sections on the home page and make the other pages, like contact us, open up a new page.
    8. The following should be included in your portfolio:

        * Your name
        * A paragraph about yourself
        * Projects (everything you have done, both zuri and outside)
        * Services 
        * Hobbies, priotities, and other skills
        * Somewhere on the page where it makes sense visually, add a photo of yourself.
        * Name
        * Email
        * Message
